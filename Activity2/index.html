                            <h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
                            <p>Great might be an understatement. </p>
                            <p>One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is
                                widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; </p>
                            <p>a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work
                                began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. </p>
                            <p>Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls for lengthy
                                stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. </p>
                            <p>One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness. Although it was
                                built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall largely failed</p>
                            <p>to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as
                                “political propaganda.”</p>

                                Toltecs—</p>
                            <p>a number of important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the

                            <p>stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the
                                Main Plaza.</p>
                            <p>A testament to the Mayans’astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365

                            <p>mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock
                            </p>
                            <p>and water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and
                            </p>
                            <p>during this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for</p>
                            <p>spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the</p>
                            <p>sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a</p>
                            <p>water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly
                            </p>
                            <p>had a population of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted.

                            <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who

                            <p>believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century </p>

                            <p>of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins

                            <p>was likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it

                            <p>Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide</p>
                            <p>of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da</p>

                            <p>features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who</p>
                            <p>watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though men</p>
                            <p>battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes pumped into the</p>

                            <p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic</p>
                            <p>monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by</p>
                            <p>Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the
                            </p>
                            <p>Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and

                            <p>20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden with a</p>
                            <p>reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones
                            </p>
                            <p>in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four</p>
                            <p>smaller domes. According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum</p>
                            <p>made out of black marble. However, he was deposed by one of his sons before any work</p>
