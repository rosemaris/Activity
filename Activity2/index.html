                    <h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
                    <p>Great might be an understatement. </p>
                    <p>One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is
                        widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; </p>
                    <p>a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work
                        began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. </p>
                    <p>Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls for lengthy
                        stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. </p>
                    <p>One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness. Although it was
                        built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall largely failed</p>
                    <p>to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as
                        “political propaganda.”</p>

                    <h1>Chichén Itzá</h1>
                    <p>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the
                        9th </p>
                    <p>and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribeItzá—who werestrongly influenced by the
                        Toltecs—</p>
                    <p>a number of important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the
                    </p>
                    <p>stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the
                        Main Plaza.</p>
                    <p>A testament to the Mayans’astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365
                        steps,</p>

                    <p>head. Life there was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá </p>
                    <p>is home to the largest tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the </p>
                    <p>Americas. On that field the residents played a ritual ball </p>

                    <h1>Petra</h1>
                    <p>The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone
                    </p>
                    <p>mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock
                    </p>
                    <p>and water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and
                    </p>
                    <p>during this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for</p>
                    <p>spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the</p>
                    <p>sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a</p>
                    <p>water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly
                    </p>
                    <p>had a population of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted.
                    </p>
                    <p>A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and after another tremor hit in</p>
                    <p>551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although rediscovered in 1912, it was largely</p>
                    <p>ignored by archaeologists until the late 20th century, and many questions remain about
                    </p>

                    <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who
                    </p>
                    <p>believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century </p>

                    <p>of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins
                    </p>
                    <p>of theSun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it
                    </p>
                    <p>was likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it

                    <p>apparently should not be is the site of a beer commercial. In 2000 a crane being </p>
                    <p>used for such an ad fell and cracked a monument.) What is known is that Machu </p>

                    <p>Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide</p>
                    <p>of godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da</p>
                    <p>Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was</p>
                    <p>completed five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not
                    </p>
                    <p>including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms</p>

                    <p>The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian.
                    </p>

                    <p>A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and
                    </p>
                    <p>features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who</p>
                    <p>watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though men</p>
                    <p>battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes pumped into the</p>
                    <p>Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians were martyred
                    </p>
                    <p>there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. According to some estimates, about</p>
                    <p>500,000 people died in the Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were captured and</p>
                    <p>then killed there that certain species reportedly became extinct.</p>

                    <p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic</p>
                    <p>monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by</p>
                    <p>Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the
                    </p>
                    <p>Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and
                    </p>
                    <p>20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden with a</p>
                    <p>reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones
                    </p>
                    <p>in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four</p>
                    <p>smaller domes. According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum</p>
                    <p>made out of black marble. However, he was deposed by one of his sons before any work</p>
